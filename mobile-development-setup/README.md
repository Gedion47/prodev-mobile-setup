# Expo Go Setup for React Native Development
## 📌 Objective
Mobile development demands more computational resources compared to web development.
To ensure a smooth development experience, we will be using the Expo Framework for React Native, which simplifies mobile app development and testing.

This task focuses on setting up Expo Go on your physical device.

## ✅ Prerequisites
Before proceeding, make sure you already have the following installed:

Node.js LTS
Visual Studio Code (recommended IDE)
A compatible operating system: macOS, Linux, or Windows
## 📲 Why Expo Go?
Unlike web development, mobile development typically relies on device emulators to test applications.
However, emulators require high computational resources and keeping up with the ever-changing mobile ecosystem can be costly.

Expo Go provides a cost-effective solution by allowing you to:

Run and test React Native applications directly on your physical device.
Support both iOS and Android seamlessly.
Avoid dependency on heavy emulators.
## 🚀 Steps to Install Expo Go
Visit the official Expo Go homepage: https://expo.dev/go
Select the latest SDK version.
Install Expo Go on your device:
Android → Install from Google Play Store
iOS → Install from Apple App Store
Open the Expo Go app on your device.
Create a new account or log in if you already have one.
## 📝 Setup Documentation
Document your setup process in this file.
Include:
